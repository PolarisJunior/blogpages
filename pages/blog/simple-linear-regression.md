# Simple Linear Regression

Linear regression is a model for predicting the value of a dependent variable `y`, given the value of an independent variable `x`. Being a **linear** model, linear regression works best when the relationship between `x` and `y` is linear. 

## Scalar Linear Equation

Recall the basic equation for a straight line where all values are scalar:

    y = mx + b

`y` is the dependent variable, also known as the response. It is the value we are trying to predict. 

`x` is the independent variable, also known as an explanatory variable. It is the input into our model. Usually it is a variable we are able to observe. We use `x` to make a prediction of what `y` is.

`m` is the coefficient, it is the value that describes by how much `y` changes as `x` changes. In calculus terms, since we know the derivative with respect to `x` is `dy/dx=m`, it is correct to describe `m` as the rate of change of `y` with respect to `x`.

`b` is the constant term, it is used to offset the value of `y` predicted. 

## Multiple Dependent Variables

$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
  
When \(a \neq 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
